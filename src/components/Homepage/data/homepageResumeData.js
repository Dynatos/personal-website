    aboutMe: `Welcome to my personal website! Here I host some of the client-side apps that I built as a Junior React developer.
    This site was born out of desire to learn about deployment, hosting, SSL/TLS, etc. In the process I learned
    about Single Page Apps and some of the client-side idiosyncrasies therein. Utilizes modern tech such as
    Node, React, Redux, Webpack, & Docker. Source code available on my GitHub. Hosting
    is trivialized thanks to Docker. Previously utilized LetsEncrypt for a free SSL certificate, since migrated to CloudFlare.
    Service on port 80 (HTTP) is redirected to 443 (HTTPS) thanks to NGINX. Please feel free to contact me!`,
