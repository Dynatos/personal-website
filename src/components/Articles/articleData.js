    title: "A Whole New Jupiter: First Science Results from NASA’s Juno Mission",
    body: `Early science results from NASA’s Juno mission to Jupiter portray the largest planet in our solar system as a complex, gigantic, turbulent world, with Earth-sized polar cyclones, plunging storm systems that travel deep into the heart of the gas giant, and a mammoth, lumpy magnetic field that may indicate it was generated closer to the planet’s surface than previously thought.
          “We are excited to share these early discoveries, which help us better understand what makes Jupiter so fascinating,” said Diane Brown, Juno program executive at NASA Headquarters in Washington. "It was a long trip to get to Jupiter, but these first results already demonstrate it was well worth the journey.”
          Juno launched on Aug. 5, 2011, entering Jupiter’s orbit on July 4, 2016. The findings from the first data-collection pass, which flew within about 2,600 miles (4,200 kilometers) of Jupiter's swirling cloud tops on Aug. 27, are being published this week in two papers in the journal Science, as well as 44 papers in Geophysical Research Letters.`,

    title: "Oli Sykes on how Bring Me The Horizon accidentally became rockstars",
    body: `“None of it makes sense,” says Oli Sykes. “But nothing in life makes sense to me.”
          It’s a reasonable way for anyone to think after everything that’s happened in 2016. But it’s maybe inevitable when you’re the singer of Bring Me The Horizon, a metal band that not long ago were playing to tiny clubs and are about to play two nights at the O2 Arena.
          And that’s just the latest apparent absurdity for a band to whom each achievement seems to come as a welcome surprise. Bring Me The Horizon released their fifth album, That’s The Spirit, in late 2015; its poppier sound launched the band to critical acclaim and an almost number one album. Then the group played the Royal Albert Hall with an orchestra and a choir. The band look dangerously close to becoming rockstars, bringing metal to audiences of a size not seen in the UK since the 1980s. `,
